Training-ICustomTypeDescriptor
==============================

The project tests the utility of the interface ICustomTypeDescriptor. 
This interface is used to add custom type description outside of what the standard TypeDescriptor provides.

The application is developed with WPF and uses the control PropertyGrid to prove the addition of custom properties at runtime.
